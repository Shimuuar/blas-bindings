This package provide low level bindings to CBLAS routines. CBLAS is
standard C API for BLAS.

The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations.
The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the
Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform
matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and
widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality
linear algebra software, LAPACK for example.

For more information, see the Netlib BLAS webpage:

Optional cabal flags

* -fTraceCalls trace every BLAS call. Useful for debugging.
