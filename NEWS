Changes in 0.5:

* Add Banded matrix data type, as well as Tri Banded and Herm Banded.

* Add support for trapezoidal dense matrices (Tri Matrix (m,n) e, where
  m is not the same as n).  Note that trapezoidal banded matrices are
  *NOT* supported.

* Add Diag matrix data type for diagonal matrices.

* Add Perm matrix data type, for permutation matrices.

* Enhance the RMatrix and RSolve type classes with an API that allows 
  specifying where to store the result of a computation.
  
* Enhance the IMatrix, RMatrix, ISolve, and RSolve type classes to add
  "scale and multiply" operations.
  
* Remove the scale parameter for Tri and Herm matrix data types.

* Flatten the data types for DVector and DMatrix.

* Some inlining and unpacking performance improvements.
