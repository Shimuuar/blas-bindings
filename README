To build the package, there is no need to run the configure script.  Just
use the standard cabal commands:

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install
    
The package uses a script to find what BLAS and LAPACK libraries to link with.
To link with a custom BLAS or LAPACK, add the "--with-blas=<lib>" 
or "--with-lapack=<lib>" argument to --configure-option.  For example,

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --configure-option="--with-blas=<lib>"

To build this package from the git repository, first run
    aclocal -I m4
    autoreconf
